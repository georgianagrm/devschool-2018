          <h2 id="ireland">7 Interesting facts about Ireland</h4>
            <p>
              My latest trip to Ireland took me to an area of the country I
              had never visited: the newly renamed Reeks District. I spent my
              time hiking, kayaking, surfing and learning that there’s much
              more to Ireland than wild waters and high hills. The island has
              a reputation rich in history, tradition, literature and music,
              not to mention its charismatic and friendly people. Over the
              years, I’ve picked up numerous interesting facts about Ireland.
              Here, I share my favourites.

                alt="Ireland is known as the Emerald Isle">
              <li>Ireland is known as the Emerald Isle because of its lush
                rolling hills and vales of green. Poet William Drennan
                is thought to be the first to use the phrase in print,
                in his poem When Erin First Rose.(Source:<a href="https://www.libraryireland.com/CIL/DrennanErin.php"
                  target="_blank">Library Ireland</a> )
              </li>
              <li>During the 1840s, Ireland’s staple crop – the potato –
                failed, leading to the Great Famine. An estimated
                million people died of starvation and disease between
                1846 and 1851, and two million emigrated between 1845
                and 1855.

              <li>Ireland has been used as a location for several famous
                films including Star Wars, The Princess Bride,
                Braveheart and Harry Potter.

                alt="A goat is crowned King Puck at the Puck Fair">
              <li>One of the most curious facts about Ireland takes place in
                the town of Killorglin in the Reeks District. Here, a
                festival known as the Puck Fair sees a goat crowned as
                King Puck for three days. The Queen of Puck,
                traditionally a local young schoolgirl, crowns the
                goat.

              </li>
              <li>Halloween is derived from the Irish festival of Samhain. At
                the end of summer, the Celts believed the gulf between
                our world and the world of ghosts and spirits thinned,
                allowing malevolent beings to wander the Earth. Irish
                immigrants in the US raised the popularity of Halloween
                in the 19th century.

                in the world after Czech Republic, Namibia, Austria,

              <li>Ireland has won the Eurovision Song Contest more than any
                other country – a record seven times (1970, 1980, 1987,
                1992, 1993, 1994 and 1996). It was also the first
                country to win the contest three times in a row.

          <h2 id="australia">6 Interesting facts about Australia</h4>
            <p>From a giant dingo fence to the planet’s largest living structure, I
              took a look at the most interesting facts about Australia.
              In a country the size of a continent there are innumerable
              fascinating facts to be unearthed. Australia’s mix of ancient
              cultures, wild terrain and cosmopolitan cities means the
              country has so much to offer the millions of visitors it
              receives every year. With red outback sands, tropical
              aquamarine reefs and the wild Southern Ocean, Australia is a
              land of truly diverse landscapes.
              Me and my friends spent a month exploring this vast country and
              learnt many interesting facts about Australia along the way.
              Here, we share the best of them.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>At 7,741,220sq km, Australia is the world’s 6th largest
                country by area (excluding Antarctica), but with only
                23 million people it is only the 56th largest by
                population, making Australia one of the world’s least
                densely populated countries with only three people per
                square kilometre.
                (Source: <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/as.html" target="_blank">CIA
                  World Factbook</a>)</li>
              <li>Australia is also the lowest, the flattest and (apart from
                Antarctica) the driest continent. The highest mountain
                in Australia is Mount Kosciuszko at just 2,228m
                (7,310ft) high.

                  target="_blank">Australian Government</a> )</li>
              <li>Completed in 1885, the Dingo Fence in Australia is the
                longest fence in the world. Designed to keep the feral
                dogs of the Australian outback away from sheep, the
                Dingo fence is 5,614km long and would take an estimated
                six months to walk around.

              <li>Australia’s Great Barrier Reef is the planet’s largest
                living structure. It stretches over 2,000km north to
                south and covers 350,000 sq km in total.

              <li>In 1967, Australia’s Prime Minister, Harold Holt,
                mysteriously disappeared after going for a swim at
                Cheviot Beach near Melbourne. His body was never
                recovered, leading to numerous conspiracy theories
                including one that claimed he had been taken by a
                Chinese submarine.

              <li>Australia is home to some of the world’s most dangerous
                animals. These include the inland taipan, the world’s
                most venomous snake; the Sydney funnel-web spider, one
                of the world’s most dangerous spiders; and the box
                jellyfish, the most dangerous marine animal known to
                humans. There are also sharks, crocodiles and giant
                centipedes to fear!

                alt="A Tinggly gift box is an excellent Christmas gift for travellers">
              <p>Tinggly gift boxes are an ingenious Christmas gift for
                travellers. Instead of buying someone a specific
                experience, you can buy them a Tinggly gift box, a
                curated collection of experiences from which they can
                choose the experience they want most. Collections are
                created around themes and hold hundreds of experiences
                from over 100 countries across the globe. For example,
                the Bucket List collection has over 600 experiences be
                it skydiving over the Namib Desert or hunting the
                Northern Lights in Iceland while the Key to Europe
                collection offers over 200 experiences including dinner
                and a concert in the heart of Florence or a sunset
                cruise in Santorini.</p>

                elements of a hiking backpack combined with everyday
                features such as laptop and gadget compartments, a
                zippered shoe compartment and a separate wet/muddy gear
                compartment. They also have a more rigid exterior
                similar to that of a suitcase.The packs open like a

              <p>The small company based in Bali creates a range of
                illustrated maps designed specifically for travellers.
                I’ve selected a 97.5 x 56cm hiking map that comes in
                paper ($39) or canvas ($139) featuring 300 trails and
                hiking areas from around the world. The map includes
                information on landscape, terrain and distance as well
                as specific icons for different trail types, serving as
                a lovely reminder of those precious days spent on the
                trail.</p>

              <p>This USB charger is the size of a lipstick but provides
                enough juice to get a device or two back up to speed in
                an emergency.
                The stick can be powered up via mains USB, PC or car
                USB prior to leaving civilisation and then used to
                provide a full charge to a variety of gadgets including
                all smartphones, e-readers and digital cameras.The
                stick includes an LED display of the remaining charge,
                and is light and portable enough to keep in your
                daypack.

                It has been invaluable on our many forays into the
                wilderness and is one our most highly recommended
                Christmas gifts for travellers.</p>

                adaptor is a clear favourite among frequent travellers.

                have to carry numerous adaptors on long trips abroad.
                The different components slide in and out of the
                compact self-contained unit which means you won’t lose
                any vital pieces. It also doubles up as a USB charger,
                making it the perfect Christmas gift for the practical
                traveller.</p>
