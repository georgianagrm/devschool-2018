                <h4>7 Interesting facts about Ireland</h4>
                <p>
                            My latest trip to Ireland took me to an area of the country I had never visited: the newly renamed Reeks District. I spent my time hiking, kayaking, surfing and learning that there’s much more to Ireland than wild waters and high hills. The island has a reputation rich in history, tradition, literature and music, not to mention its charismatic and friendly people. Over the years, I’ve picked up numerous interesting facts about Ireland. Here, I share my favourites.  
                </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Ireland is known as the Emerald Isle because of its lush rolling hills and vales of green. Poet William Drennan is thought to be the first to use the phrase in print, in his poem When Erin First Rose.(Source:<a href="https://www.libraryireland.com/CIL/DrennanErin.php" target="_blank">Library Ireland</a> )
                            <img class="imag" src="https://www.atlasandboots.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/interesting-facts-about-ireland-7.jpg" alt="Ireland is known as the Emerald Isle"></li>                     
                        <li>During the 1840s, Ireland’s staple crop – the potato – failed, leading to the Great Famine. An estimated million people died of starvation and disease between 1846 and 1851, and two million emigrated between 1845 and 1855.
                                (Source: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/victorians/famine_01.shtml" target="_blank">BBC</a>)</li>
                        <li>Ireland has been used as a location for several famous films including Star Wars, The Princess Bride, Braveheart and Harry Potter.

                        <li>One of the most curious facts about Ireland takes place in the town of Killorglin in the Reeks District. Here, a festival known as the Puck Fair sees a goat crowned as King Puck for three days. The Queen of Puck, traditionally a local young schoolgirl, crowns the goat.
                                (Source: <a href="http://puckfair.ie/" target="_blank">Puck Fair</a>)

                        <li>Halloween is derived from the Irish festival of Samhain. At the end of summer, the Celts believed the gulf between our world and the world of ghosts and spirits thinned, allowing malevolent beings to wander the Earth. Irish immigrants in the US raised the popularity of Halloween in the 19th century.
                                (Source: <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/15169373" target="_blank">BBC</a>)</li>
                        <li> Ireland is the sixth highest consumer of beer per capita in the world after Czech Republic, Namibia, Austria, Germany and Poland.
                                (Source: <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/beer-consumption-per-capita-countries/" target="_blank">The Telegraph</a>)</li>
                        <li>Ireland has won the Eurovision Song Contest more than any other country – a record seven times (1970, 1980, 1987, 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1996). It was also the first country to win the contest three times in a row.

                <h4>6 Interesting facts about Australia</h4>
                <p>From a giant dingo fence to the planet’s largest living structure, I took a look at the most interesting facts about Australia.
                        In a country the size of a continent there are innumerable fascinating facts to be unearthed. Australia’s mix of ancient cultures, wild terrain and cosmopolitan cities means the country has so much to offer the millions of visitors it receives every year. With red outback sands, tropical aquamarine reefs and the wild Southern Ocean, Australia is a land of truly diverse landscapes.
                        Me and my friends spent a month exploring this vast country and learnt many interesting facts about Australia along the way. Here, we share the best of them.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>At 7,741,220sq km, Australia is the world’s 6th largest country by area (excluding Antarctica), but with only 23 million people it is only the 56th largest by population, making Australia one of the world’s least densely populated countries with only three people per square kilometre.
                            (Source: <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/as.html" target="_blank">CIA World Factbook</a>)</li>
                    <li>Australia is also the lowest, the flattest and (apart from Antarctica) the driest continent. The highest mountain in Australia is Mount Kosciuszko at just 2,228m (7,310ft) high.
                            (Source: <a href="https://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/our-country/the-australian-continent" target="_blank">Australian Government</a> )</li>
                    <li>Completed in 1885, the Dingo Fence in Australia is the longest fence in the world. Designed to keep the feral dogs of the Australian outback away from sheep, the Dingo fence is 5,614km long and would take an estimated six months to walk around.
                            (Source: <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/the-longest-fence-in-the-world-would-take-6-months-to-walk-around" target="_blank">Condé Nast Traveller</a>)</li>
                    <li>Australia’s Great Barrier Reef is the planet’s largest living structure. It stretches over 2,000km north to south and covers 350,000 sq km in total.
                            (Source: <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/world-heritage/great-barrier-reef/" target="_blank">National Geographic</a>)

                    <li>In 1967, Australia’s Prime Minister, Harold Holt, mysteriously disappeared after going for a swim at Cheviot Beach near Melbourne. His body was never recovered, leading to numerous conspiracy theories including one that claimed he had been taken by a Chinese submarine.
                            (Source: <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/12/16/asia/australia-harold-holt-missing-anniversary-intl/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a>)</li>
                    <li>Australia is home to some of the world’s most dangerous animals. These include the inland taipan, the world’s most venomous snake; the Sydney funnel-web spider, one of the world’s most dangerous spiders; and the box jellyfish, the most dangerous marine animal known to humans. There are also sharks, crocodiles and giant centipedes to fear!

                                    <p>Technical trekking and mountaineering backpack specialist Gregory have launched a line of adventure travel packs that serve as excellent backpacks-cum-suitcases for the active traveller.The backpacks have many of the usual elements of a hiking backpack combined with everyday features such as laptop and gadget compartments, a zippered shoe compartment and a separate wet/muddy gear compartment. They also have a more rigid exterior similar to that of a suitcase.The packs open like a suitcase, but also provide the comfort of a traditional backpack. There are two models available: the Praxus designed for men and the Proxy for women. Both models come in a 45-litre and a 65-litre version.</p>

The map includes information on landscape, terrain and distance as well as specific icons for different trail types, serving as a lovely reminder of those precious days spent on the trail.</p>
